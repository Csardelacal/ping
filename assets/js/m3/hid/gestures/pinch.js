/**
 * For pinches to work properly, we need to make sure the viewport is set to 
 * ignore zooming. This is due to the way we handle touch events.
 * 
 * Touch events can get awfully messy when the user has control over the viewport
 * scaling, and therefore we block them from being used when the device is at any
 * zoom level but the default.
 * 
 * Therefore, pinch events are mostly not gonna work unless the viewport is set to:
 * width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimim-scale=1.0
 *
