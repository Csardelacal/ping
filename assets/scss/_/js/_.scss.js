 * Some of the features that _SCSS provides cannot be provided without Javascript.
 * This includes, but is not limited to some forms of dialogs, form elements, etc.
 * 
 * When using these elements the system should fallback to a basic CSS / SCSS 
 * solution until the javascript required to make it work is either loaded or 
 * available.
 * 
 * My intention for this script is to reduce it to the bare minimum, doing as much
