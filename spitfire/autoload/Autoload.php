 * 
 * This autoloader supports the use of ClassLocators, which will actually perform
 * the task of retrieving the class. It will loop over these locators sequentially
 * and stopping once one of the locators has had a positive match.
 * 
 * Therefore you should avoid having locators that could generate false positives.
 * Since these might screw your system up.
