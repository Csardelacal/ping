 * A collection is a set of values that can be iterated over and can apply certain
 * operations to it's values.
 * 
 * One quirk of the collection is that it superceeds both array like data that
 * is defined within the app's scope and for pointers - for which the application
 * does not know the scope ahead of reading it from a source.
 * 
 * The collection should always be able to provide an array for the data it 
 * contains via the toArray() method. It is possible though that this method
 * throws an exception to indicate that the data cannot be casted to array.
