/**
 * A foreign key is a special index in MySQL that allows the system to improve
 * performance on joins and to maintain data consistency in the database in 
 * the event of data being modified.
 * 
 * Spitfire defaults to cascading changes inside the database, since it's models
 * imply that when a child is orphaned it should be removed. If you still wish
 * to orphan a model it's recommended you orphan it before removing the parent.
 * 
 * This is similar to how you would expect the garbage collector of a object 
 * oriented language to work. If a element is deleted and the children are not 
 * referenced elsewhere we'd expect them to be gone.
