	 * gonna copy itself and move all of it's restrictions to the new query.
	 * 
	 * This means that when serializing the query, the composite restriction should
	 * not print <code>old.primary IS NOT NULL</code> but <code>new.primary IS NOT NULL</code>.
	 * 
	 * But! When the parent injects the restrictions to connect the queries with 
	 * the parent, the old query must answer the call and assimilate them.
	 * 
	 * To achieve this behavior, I found it reasonable that the query introduces 
	 * a redirection property. When a composite restriction finds this, it will
	 * automatically use the target of the redirection.
	 * 
	 * NOTE: Composite queries do not follow multiple redirections.
