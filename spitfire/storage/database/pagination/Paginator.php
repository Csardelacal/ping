/**
 * This class is the base for the database query pagination inside of Spitfire.
 * It provides the necessary tools to generate a list of pages inside your 
 * applications so queries aren't able to collapse your system / clients.
 * 
 * By default this class includes a getEmpty method that returns a message when 
 * no results are available. Although it is not a good practice to allow classes
 * perform actions that aren't strictly related to their task. But the improvement
 * on readability gained in Views is worth the change.
 * 
 * @link http://www.spitfirephp.com/wiki/index.php/Database/pagination Related data and tutorials
 * 
 * @todo Somehow this class should cache the counts, so the database doesn't need to read the data every time.
 * @todo This class should help paginating without the use of LIMIT
 * @todo Update the pertinent documentation on the wiki
